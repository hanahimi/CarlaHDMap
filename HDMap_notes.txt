HDMap elements of interest:
- Road
  Consists of road sections (we'll leave it at one section) and a junction_id,
  if the road is contained within a junction.
  The road section consists of lanes with the same direction.
- Lane
  The most complex structure, containing a lot of information regarding a single
  lane. Its main components are:
  - the center of the lane
  - the left and right boundaries of the lane
  - length and speed limit
  - the ids of the overlap structures associated with the lane
  - the previous and the next lane
  - the left and right neighbor lane, from the same road structure (in case of
  a multilane road structure)
  - type of lane (CITY_DRIVING, BIKING, SIDEWALK, PARKING)
  - the type of turn the lane makes
  - left and right distances from lane center to lane boundaries, each point on
  the lane center being sampled relative to the lane start
  - direction (which I can't see why it wouldn't always be FORWARD)
  Note: There is also a field junction_id that need not be used, as in the case
  of overlap with a junction, this would already be marked in an overlap
  structure.
  Left and right boundaries could normally be defined in Carla as being at a
  constant distance from the lane center, as lanes have the same width
  everywhere.
- Junction
  Consists of a polygon that encloses the area of the junction and a series of
  overlap ids.
- Overlap
  It's represented as a pair of overlaping objects, each of which could be a
  lane, a junction, a stop sign etc.
  The lane overlap structure contains information about the start and end points
  of the overlap, relative to the start of the lane.

Useful contour lines:
- road edges
- road center
- lanes center
